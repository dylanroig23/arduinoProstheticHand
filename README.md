# Arduino "Prosthetic" Hand Project

Hi there! This project was done for a Hackathon as well as a big interest in getting back 
into some Arduino programming. With that being said, **all aspects of it may not be perfect**
but hopefully they can potentially be useful. This is one of my first experiences setting
up my own repository with GitHub as well so **apologies if not everything is up with industry standard.** 
I will be making commmits to this repository as I go and once I am done I will post some 
pictures/videos of the final product as well as some of the Mechanical Engineering
that went into modeling the hand. Thanks!

## Why a Prosetetic Hand Project? 

Gaining some exposure into the world of Biomedical Engineering has always been an 
interest of mine and it was honestly just something that sparked some interest. 
It was been a little while since I have gotten to do any work with Ardino and I 
have been trying to find an interesting project for awhile now and this project 
looked like a good way to get back into Arduino. 

## How Was The Project Completed

**Arduino IDE is not supported by GitHub Desktop** the way that this was handled 
was just by working with VS Code and copying and pasting the project from Arduino
IDE into a VS Code project. This way it was easy to commit changes to the repository 
from GitHub Desktop. There are extensions that you can add into VS Code to eminate 
the Arduino IDE but I wanted to get some familiarity back with the Arduino IDE even 
though it is regarded by many as subpar.
